Real-time cat and dog detection using YOLOv8 and a live camera feed. Built with Python &amp; OpenCV for fast and accurate object recognition.

# 🐾 Cat & Dog Detection with YOLOv8

This project uses the **YOLOv8** object detection model to identify cats and dogs in **real-time** using a live camera feed.  
It’s built with **Python** and **OpenCV**, making it fast, accurate, and easy to run on most systems.

 Requirements
 <br>
Python 3.8+
 <br>
OpenCV
 <br>
Ultralytics YOLOv8
 <br>
Webcam or camera device

 <br>
🧠 How It Works
 <br>
The YOLOv8 model processes frames from your webcam in real-time.
 <br>
It detects and classifies objects into "Cat" or "Dog".
 <br>
Bounding boxes and labels are drawn around detected animals.
 <br>
📸 Example Output
 <br>
[ Cat Detected at (x1, y1, x2, y2) ]
 <br>
[ Dog Detected at (x1, y1, x2, y2) ]
